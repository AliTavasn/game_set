#### Description:
My name is Ali Tavassolinia and this is my final CS50x project. 
This project is a game set which includes 2 games. A Hangman game and an X-O game. This project is written in Python and contains three Python files. A file called game.py, and README.md and a folder named games are in the project folder. in games folder there are two python files named hangman.py and x_o.py and a text file named Random_words.txt wich i explain them later. the game.py file which is the main file, welcomes the user like a menu and links him to 2 other game files. In this file, after the welcome, 3 options are presented to you: First, if you want to play the hangman game, enter 1, If you want to play the X-O game, enter 2, and if you want to exit the game file completely, enter 3. Error handling is implemented in this file and enter anything other than 1, 2 or 3, it will ask you for input again. If you enter 1, you will be directed to the hangman.py file. This file is the same as hangman game. Its function is that it randomly selects a word from a bank of 3000 words. This bank is a text file name Random_words.txt, which has 3000 lines and each line contains a word. In Hangman game, there are 6 chances to make a mistake every time, and after guessing 6 wrong words, you lose, and if you guess the word before making a mistake 6 times, you win. The letters you guessed correctly are placed in the correct place with green color and the wrong letters are placed in red at the bottom of the word to remember which letters we entered incorrectly. The error handling in this game is completely done too and it will only accept it if you enter an alphabetic character that you have not entered before, otherwise it will ask you to enter again with an error message. After the end of the game (win or lose), a message will be displayed to you, which is actually the game.py file that displays this message as follows: if you want to play again, enter 1, if you want to play X - O game, enter 2, and if you want to exit the game, enter 3. If you enter 2, you will be redirected to the X - O game. This is a two_player game and you have to play with your friend who is next to the deacon. In this game, there is an initial table that has 9 houses and there is a number in each house and the numbers are from 1 to 9. The game starts with X's turn, and whenever X plays his turn, it is O's turn, and until the end, the turns are switched in the same way. Lets suppose now it is X's turn. The user must enter the number of the house in which he wants X to be placed, and then X will be placed in that house and it will be the opposite person's turn. X is shown in red color and O is shown in blue color for more readability. And again, error handling is completely done and all inappropriate user behavior is predicted and leads to getting input again. There is no loser in this game. In fact, either one of the players wins or both of them draw. After finishing the game, 3 options are shown again by the game.py file: if you want to play again, enter 2, if you want to play the hangman game, enter 1, and if you want to exit the program completely, enter 3. If you enter 3, it will automatically exit the program.

This was the summary of my project. Thank you for reading.
